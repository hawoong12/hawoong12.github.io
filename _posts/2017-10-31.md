title: set browser title and meta tag
---

today,
i try to set browser title and meta tag on nshomeshopping.
it was simple but it was a repetition of simple work.
unlike mobile programming source, shoppingmall source didn't have summarizing url pattern. 
so i analyze all page(jsp), for example product detail, catalog display and so on.
i spend it all day.

browser title and meta tag are upgraded googling or naver searching result.
